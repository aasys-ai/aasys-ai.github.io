                    Piccola is our Micromouse. It means small. With piccola we learnt a lot. A lot about
                    PCB designs, hardware designing and specially we learnt about our new favourite
                    micro-controller, STM32 blue pill. Building piccola was so interesting. We spent
                    almost 3 months working day and night. It took us one month to design the hardware
                    and the PCB. After we got over PCB fabricated, the real game begun. We were able to
                    build hardware of piccola within a week. Then it was all about coding and it was even
                    more interesting. When building piccola, lot of time was invested in tunning. We wanted
                    to make all the moves very precise and predictable. Throughout 3 month the experience we
                    got is incredible.
