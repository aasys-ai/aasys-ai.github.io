                        Piccola is our Micromouse. It means small. With piccola we learnt a lot. A lot about
                        PCB designs, hardware designing and specially we learnt about our new favourite
                        micro-controller, STM32 blue pill. Building piccola was so interesting. We spent
                        almost 3 months working day and night. It took us one month to design the hardware
                        and the PCB. After we got over PCB fabricated, the real game begun. We were able to
                        build hardware of piccola within a week. Then it was all about coding and it was even
                        more interesting. When building piccola, lot of time was invested in tunning. We wanted
                        to make all the moves very precise and predictable. Throughout 3 month the experience we
                        got is incredible.

                        Predicting online shoppers purchase intention just by looking at the data is almost
                        imposible. But with a machine learning approach, it's not that hard. However it take some 
                        effort. Infact when we tried doing it, we took three steps. Data pre-processing, feature
                        engineering and prediction model building. Following these three steps we were able to 
                        predict with a accuracy of 95%. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        To be honest, this is one of the most interesting projects we have done. It would be great
                        if you check out our work. Read our articles we wrote on this. It's fun!
