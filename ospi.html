                    Predicting online shoppers purchase intention just by looking at the data is almost
                    imposible. But with a machine learning approach, it's not that hard. However it take some 
                    effort. Infact when we tried doing it, we took three steps. Data pre-processing, feature
                    engineering and prediction model building. Following these three steps we were able to 
                    predict with a accuracy of 95%.

                    To be honest, this is one of the most interesting projects we have done. It would be great
                    if you check out our work. Read our articles we wrote on this. It's fun!
