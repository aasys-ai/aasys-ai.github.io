                            Robots are rapidly moving from characters and concepts only found in science
                            fiction to part of our everyday lives. Although they might sometimes seem to be
                            electro-mechanical mysteries, personal robotics is becoming more accessible
                            every day! Cheaper, higher quality, and easier to use components are now just
                            a click away, and amazing individuals around the planet are volunteering
                            countless hours to make the software and experience of building robots fun and
                            easy to understand.

                            Computer vision has been around for more than 50 years, but recently, we see a
                            major resurgence of interest in how machines ‘see’ and how computer vision can be
                            used to build products for consumers and businesses. Few examples of such applications
                            are- Amazon Go, Google Lens, Autonomous Vehicles, Face Recognition. The key driving
                            factor behind all these is Computer Vision. In the simplest terms, Computer Vision
                            is the discipline under a broad area of Artificial Intelligence which teaches machines
                            to see. Its goal is to extract meaning from pixels.

                            Artificial intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other
                            innovation this century. Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves
                            feeling left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more
                            like magic. The rate of acceleration is already astounding. After a couple of AI
                            winters and periods of false hope over the past four decades, rapid advances in data
                            storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent
                            years.
